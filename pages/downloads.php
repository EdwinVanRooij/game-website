					<br>The client is a manipulated version of the official game client, it has been modified to connect to our server. Before you run the client you have to extract all files inside the archive to your MapleStory installation directory, you can do that using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" target="_blank">WinRAR</a>.
					<br><br>Often our client files will be detected as an intrusion/virus, however, rest assured, our files are 100% clean. Please add them as an exception or turn off your anti-virus completely should you run into any problems.
